Linear Regression

This project involves the analysis and implementation of different loss functions for linear regression.
Concepts covered: Linear regression, loss functions (quadratic loss, mean absolute error, Huber loss), gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and handling outliers.


Project 1: Exploratory Data Visualization with R

This project focuses on exploratory data visualization using the ggplot2 package in R.
Concepts covered: Data exploration, data visualization, ggplot2 syntax, and visualization best practices.


Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis using R

This lab focuses on introducing the basics of R programming language and exploratory data analysis.
Concepts covered: R syntax, data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical summaries.


Project 3: Cross Validation and Bootstrap in R

This lab covers cross-validation techniques and bootstrapping methods for model evaluation and parameter estimation.
Concepts covered: Validation set approach, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), k-fold cross-validation, bootstrap, and estimating model accuracy.
